<details>  <summary style="font-size: 28px; color: blue;"> Rate Amplification and Query-Efficient Distance Amplification for linear LCC and LDC </summary> 
We show a rate amplification procedure for Locally Correctable Codes (LCC). The procedure converts any $q$-query linear LCC, having rate $\rho$ and, say, constant distance to an asymptotically good LCC with $q^{\poly(1/\rho)}$ queries. We also show a distance amplification procedure for Locally Decodable Codes (LDC) that converts any linear LDC with distance $\delta$ and, say, constant rate to an asymptotically good LDC. The query complexity only suffers a multiplicative overhead that is roughly equal to the query complexity of a length $1/\delta$ asymptotically good LDC. This improves upon the $\poly(1/\delta)$ overhead obtained by the AEL distance amplification procedure by [AL96, AEL95]. As linear LCC are LDC, this establishes that the construction of asymptotically good LDC is reduced, with a minor overhead in query complexity, to the problem of constructing (somewhat) negligible rate, (extremely) negligible distance linear LDC.</details>
